# shople

A simple Shopping Cart project submitted for The Odin Project course.



### Built With

- React + Vite + TypeScript; routing via react-router v7 (BrowserRouter, Routes, Link).
- **State**: Zustand stores (cartStore with localforage persistence, productStore for fetched items).
- **Styling**: Tailwind-style utility classes, custom UI primitives (button, badge, card, quantity, spinner).
- **Data**: FakeStore API.
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + JSDOM.



### Remarks

This is my second time building a React project with TypeScript. I’m using this project as a way to gradually improve my ability to work with both JavaScript and TypeScript in a real-world setup.
